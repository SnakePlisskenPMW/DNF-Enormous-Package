PREAMBLE:
This is the first release of the DukeNukemForever.exe unofficial editor using the official editor functionality released with the Duke Nukem Forever 2011 retail game. 
This build is very unstable, I'm making a binary because a lot of people are trying to build this and running into some problems. 

What is this:
People assumed the Duke Nukem Forever level editor was missing from the PC game, when in fact the DNF 2011 editor was released with the actual game, but the front end
was missing, and the logic to properly start up the editor was also missing. This project fixes that.

IT IS ADVISED YOU MAINTAIN TWO DIFFERENT DNF INSTALLS, ONE FOR THE EDITOR AND ONE FOR RUNNING THE GAME!!

Installation:
1) Install VS 2022 runtimes.
2) Go to steam and DISABLE steam overlay for ALL games.
3) Make a copy of your DNF steam folder and copy these files into the system folder.
4) Download Neosis and extract out megapackages.dat.
5) Copy the extract contents to your: system, staticmeshes, sounds, skinmeshes, particles folders. If they don't exist create them.
6) Launch DukeForeverEditor.exe

How to use:
Using the keyboard causes a crash so only use mouse controls. This includes dialogs.
File -> Open to open a map.
File -> Save as to save map.
Double click on stuff to be able to edit properies.

Known Issues:
1) Press one key on the keyboard the editor crashes.
2) A lot of functionality doesn't work.
3) If the editor crashes on startup launch it again. You might have to do this a few times.
4) The editor doesn't close all the way, so after closing out of the UI you can have to ctrl-alt-del kill the process.
5) Probably loads more issues.

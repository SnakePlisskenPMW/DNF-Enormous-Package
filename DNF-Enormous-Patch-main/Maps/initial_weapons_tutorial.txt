How to give the player starting weapons.

Create a AlwaysTrigger
	Set Events -> Event -> To: AlwaysTriggerStuff

Create a Dispatcher 
	Set Events -> Tag to: AlwaysTriggerStuff

Create TriggerPlayer
	Set Events -> Tag to: InitialInventory
	Click on TPInventory, on GiveItemClass click add, in the pulldown select whatever weapon you want, some work some don't,
	for this I choose the shotgun.

Click on the Dispatcher:
	Click on OutDelays and click on add, leave as zero.
	Click on OutEvents and click add, then click find, and click on the TriggerPlayer entity.
